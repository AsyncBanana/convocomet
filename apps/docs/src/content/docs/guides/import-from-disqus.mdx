title: Importing your comments from Disqus
description: Import your comments from your old Disqus instance

To import your comments from Disqus, first [export them](https://disqus.com/admin/discussions/export/) into a file, which should end in `.xml` or `.xml.gz`. Once you have the file, create a new [ConvoComet site](https://convocomet.dev/dashboard/create) if you haven't already. Go to the settings page of the site in the ConvoComet dashboard, and click "Import from Disqus". This should open up a menu where you can select the file Disqus gave you. Now, you should be set! Check out the [getting started guide](/guides/getting-started) next if you haven't already.
