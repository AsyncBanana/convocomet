title: Creating a Custom ConvoComet Widget
description: Use the ConvoComet SDK to integrate commenting into a custom interface
---

## Installation

The recommended way to use ConvoComet is through the [official integrations](/guides/getting-started). However, there are certain cases where you might want customization that is not available in the premade widget. Luckily, ConvoComet publishes a JavaScript SDK `@convocomet/sdk` that makes it simple to access the ConvoComet API. To use this, first install it with NPM (or your preferred packages manager):

```sh
npm install @convocomet/sdk
```

`@convocomet/sdk` exports only three functions. `loadComments`, `postComment`, and `upvote`. These all do exactly what it sounds like :{"("}.

## loadComments

`loadComments` helps load a list of comments. To call it, pass a config object containing your site id as `id` and page id as `page`. You can also pass in an optional order and continuation parameter (the continuation parameter should only be used when returned by the API for use with pagination).

Here is an example of using `loadComments`

```js
import {loadComments} from "@convocomet/sdk"
const {comments, continuation} = await loadComments({
    id: import.meta.env.CONVOCOMET_SITE_ID,
    page: 'page-slug'
}, 'newest')
```

Note that `continuation` will only be returned when there are more comments. There is currently no way to configure the number of comments loaded (it is set to 20).

## postComment

`postComment` allows you to submit comments. To use it, pass two parameters: the comment data and configuration object. The comment data should contain `text`, a boolean `notifications` for whether the user has enabled notifications, `author`, which should only be specified for anonymous users (signed in users will use the session cookie), and `sourceId`, which is the id of the comment replied to if the comment is a reply.

```js
import {postComment} from "@convocomet/sdk"
const newComment = await postComment({
    text: "Testing testing 1 2",
    notifications: false, // cannot be true without signed in user
    author: "Tester"
},{
    id: import.meta.env.CONVOCOMET_SITE_ID,
    page: 'page-slug'
})
```

## upvote

`upvote` allows you to upvote comments. To use it, simply pass in a comment id and configuration object.

```js
await upvote(COMMENT_ID, {
    id: import.meta.env.CONVOCOMET_SITE_ID,
    page: 'page-slug'
})
```
